###How Does it Work?

The **Cart Icon** gives shoppers access to their shopping cart items from wherever they are on the website.

Shoppers can easily add/remove items from their WooCommerce carts, providing them with a seamless buying experience.

Further, it gives users quick access to the checkout page by completely bypassing the conventional WooCommerce cart page.


###Why is the WooCommerce Cart by FunnelKit unique?

If you need to transform your static WooCommerce cart into a dynamic, modern swipe cart – you need the FunnelKit Cart.

- Get a **stylish slide-in shopping cart section** in WooCommerce
- Present **variable products** inside the WooCommerce side cart
- Pitch **one-click upsell and cross-sell offers** right inside the WooCommerce mini cart
- Add **milestone-based rewards** and encourage shoppers to buy more
- Easily **manage your upsell/cross-sell offers** from the same dashboard
- Custom **styling options** to make your WooCommerce cart on-brand

Since FunnelKit Cart has the option to enable or disable the **AJAX-based side cart**, you can configure whether you want to automatically update the cart items without hitting the refresh button or not.


####FunnelKit Cart Lite Features

FunnelKit Cart Lite gives you a host of customizations for your WooCommerce cart and myriad styling options to make your floating cart look on-brand.

##Display Cart Icon

A **Cart Icon** is a small icon at the bottom of your website that allows shoppers to access their shopping cart anytime, anywhere.

You can display the cart item on the entire website or certain WooCommerce pages or nowhere (instead, you can embed it on your website header or via cart shortcode). The smart side cart icon also shows a pop-up that denotes the number of items in the cart.

The Cart Icon mainly aims at minimizing the clicks to the [checkout page](https://funnelkit.com/customize-woocommerce-checkout-page/?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Checkout+Page&utm_campaign=WP+Cart+Repo) and reducing drop-offs.

##Customize Your Cart On-Brand

Customizing the WooCommerce cart to **make it look on-brand** has never been this easy.

FunnelKit Cart lets you customize your WooCommerce floating cart the way you want. Add heading, change button colors, adjust background colors, customize the text, and more.

You can play around with the Cart Style or the Icon Style and make your dynamic WooCommerce mini cart on-brand.

You have total control over everything!

##Modify the Items in Your Cart

FunnelKit Cart comes with a built-in mini cart that allows your shoppers to change the **quantity of their items or delete an item**. All with one click.

Show new buyers a **"SHOP NOW"** button and encourage them to add the first item to their cart. Display the Order Summary right inside your side cart.

##Apply Discount Coupons

Display [WooCommerce discount coupons](https://funnelkit.com/woocommerce-dynamic-coupons/?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=WooCommerce+Discount+Coupons&utm_campaign=WP+Cart+Repo) right inside the dynamic mini cart, allowing shoppers to easily apply their coupon code.

You can display the **Coupon Box** in two formats - open or collapsible. The collapsible box saves space inside the WooCommerce cart. If your shopper has their own discount coupon, they can add it manually and apply the discount.


##AJAX WooCommerce Cart

FunnelKit Cart provides you with the **AJAX Add To Cart** feature.

The AJAX add to cart and modification functionality allows you to add and update items automatically without refreshing your cart.

While disabling the AJAX add to cart option add and update the cart items by refreshing your WooCommerce cart.

With FunnelKit Cart for WooCommerce, you get both these options to use them the way you want.


#### FunnelKit Cart Pro Features

By upgrading to [Funnel Builder Pro](https://funnelkit.com/exclusive-offer/?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Funnel+Builder+Pro+Upgrade&utm_campaign=WP+Cart+Repo), you get access to premium features.

Here are some amazing FunnelKit Cart Pro features that can help **boost conversions and enhance your buyer’s shopping experience:**

##Add Upsells and Cross-Sells to the WooCommerce Side Cart

With FunnelKit Cart, you do not need to halt the buyer's journey with a [pre-purchase upsell page](https://funnelkit.com/woocommerce-upsells/?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=Pre+Purchase+Upsell+Page&utm_campaign=WP+Cart+Repo) - you can pitch upsell offers inside the cart!

Add **default upsell products** to your side cart. These offers are shown to all the buyers, regardless of which items they have in their shopping cart.

You can change the skin of your upsell offers and add style to your WooCommerce cart. Change the text, decide on maximum upsells, show offers inside the cart or on the side, and more.

Now, you can display your upsell offers in a visually appealing - and compact - way **right on the checkout page**.

The best part? You can offer any product as your upsell, whether simple, variable or subscriptions.

With just one click, your shoppers can add these upsell offers to their shopping carts.

##Add Product-Specific Upsells/Cross-Sells on the Same Page

Show different upsell items to your customers based on what they are buying.

Currently, WooCommerce lets you add upsell/cross-sell offers to your products, but that means you have to visit every product page individually and add these items.

However, FunnelKit Cart allows you to add complementary products to individual products. And that too from the same page - No more visiting each product page!

Easily **add/remove/manage** your upsell and cross-sell offers with FunnelKit Cart.

This allows you to personalize your visitor's shopping experience by suggesting hyper-relevant products to their purchase right inside the WooCommerce side cart.

##Choose from a Variety of Upsell Skins

FunnelKit Cart gives you a host of customization options to make your WooCommerce cart look on-brand, but you also get **sleek skins for your upsell offers**.

You can either show upsell offers on the side of the mini cart or inside it, your choice.

You can even **change the background color of the skin** to blend in with your brand colors.

##Select the Variants for Variable Products Inside Your Floating Cart

Earlier, when a customer wanted to buy a variable product. They had to go to the product page, select the variant, return to the default WooCommerce cart page, and head to the checkout page.

FunnelKit Cart has cut down this hectic journey to just **one click**.

If you offer a variable product as an upsell, your shopper can **choose its variations** after adding the upsell item to the cart – right inside this WooCommerce sliding cart.

They no longer need to visit the product page to choose a different variation - everything can be done with a click of a button inside the WooCommerce side cart.

##Add Milestone-based Rewards and Incentives To WooCommerce Cart

One of the most outstanding features of WooCommerce Cart by FunnelKit is its ability to gamify the shopping experience. Encourage your shoppers to **buy more in pursuit of unlocking more rewards**.

Gamifying the experience simply means adding **milestone-based rewards** to encourage shoppers to buy more. FunnelKit Cart for WooCommerce lets you add discounts, free gifts, and free shipping as rewards.

- **Free Gifts:** Give away free gifts to your shoppers after they buy items worth a certain amount. Add the product from your store as a giveaway, decide the amount to unlock, add a message, and you are done.
- **Discounts:** Encourage your customers to spend more to unlock a special discount. This way, the customer will spend more and you can close the sale at a higher order value.
- **Free Shipping:** Many shoppers abandon their carts because of high shipping costs. Thus, you can provide free shipping to buyers if they buy items worth a certain amount.

You can use either one of these rewards or all three of them and offer them to your shoppers inside the WooCommerce cart. The more you reward your buyers, the more they will spend.

FunnelKit Cart will surely help increase your order value by replacing your default WooCommerce cart page with a floating cart, giving shoppers a quick checkout experience.
